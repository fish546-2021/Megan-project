## RNA seq data: coho salmon treated with a steroid and looked at gonadal transcriptional alterations

 Data courtesy of Chris Monson (UW) and Giles Goetz (NOAA). A more through description can be found in the `data` subdirectory's readme

## Data Location
All RNA seq raw data files can be found [here](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/fish546_2021/Files_Giles_Uploaded_For_Chris/)
- Only a subset of files were used for this project due to storage limitations, but all codes are written so they can be executed with the full dataset if you have space on your computer or external hard drive to do so. The subset of files are:
`17104-02RT-01-10_S18_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz
17104-02RT-01-10_S18_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz

  - The `R1` or `R2` in the file names correspond to the read ends
  - The sequences of the adapters used in library prep are `R1` : `AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA` and `R2`: `AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT`.

### General Workflow
As of March 3rd, 2021, Week 8
Below, the code files for this project are listed and described in order. File names for the final project are formatted `step#-description`
Old file names / draft code names are formatted `MMDD-description` where MMDD is the day they were created.

#### Origin of Data:
Giles transferred the files from a NOAA server to Seteven's ostrich server. Steven then transferred them to gannet, which is linked above. The md5sum text, `0128-Giles-md5sums.txt` file generated by generated by Giles during the initial transfer is located in `data/raw/` subdirectory.


#### step1-gettingDataFromGannet.ipynb
Retrieves the data from gannet using `wget`. Recall, that not all of the files were used in this project, but all files are available on gannet.
Saves data to `data/raw/`subdirectory.

#### step2-md5sums.ipynb
Compares the file with md5sums that Giles provided, `0128-Giles-md5sums.txt`to the md5sums of the downloaded files.

#### step3-fastqcForMultipleFiles.ipynb
Runs fastqc for all of our raw data files. Output directed to `analyses/step3-fastqc/`

#### step4-multiqcOnFastqc.ipynb
Runs multiqc using all of the fastqc outputs directed to `analyses/step3-fastqc/`in order to visualize all our sequences' qualities. Output directed to `analyses/step4-multiqc/`and the html output is `multiqc_report.html` within this subdirectory. Multiqc showed that the first ~15 bp of all sequences needed to be trimmed.

#### trimming sequences to get rid of low quality chunks (first ~15 bp)
coming soon

#### kallisto to quantify expression
coming soon

#### deseq2 to visualize expression levels
coming soon
