      "     The md5 utility takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces\n",
      "     as output a ``fingerprint'' or ``message digest'' of the input.  It is\n",
      "     conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two messages\n",
      "     having the same message digest, or to produce any message having a given\n",
      "     prespecified target message digest.  The MD5 algorithm is intended for\n",
      "     digital signature applications, where a large file must be ``compressed''\n",
      "     in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private (secret) key\n",
      "     under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA.\n",

      "     MD5's designer Ron Rivest has stated \"md5 and sha1 are both clearly bro-\n",

      "\n",
      "     The following options may be used in any combination and must precede any\n",
